> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- 
Not bad as it didn't seem too difficult. I could see trying to break software to be fun, although trying to come up with so many simple, readable and clear steps for so many test cases for so many test suites could become a bit tiresome. 

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- 
First I tried to figure out what functionality there is supposed to be. Then I tried to write test cases that checked that functionality. 
I grouped test cases by positive and negative tests and tried to order them in a way they could be completed in order. 

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 -     
A tool where you can group and order different test cases in a logical way would be good. For example in the test suites for this assignment there were test cases that required other test cases to be completed first. 

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- 
Only Visual Studio Code.
     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
-
Had to stop to think should I use steps like "Click New Project button" because while it is the most clear way to write the test, if the buttons name changes the test case will have to be updated. I decided to prioritize more clear instructions.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
-
I have used GitHub before and din't run into any trouble using it.

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- 
Most likely Robot because of its easy to understand syntax.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
- 
Experience testing, using frameworks and tools, automating

Experience with CI/CD pipeline

Proficiency in scripting automated tests

Problemsolving and analytical skills

Initiative

Knowledge in programing languages

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
- 
Experience testing and using tools, frameworks, CI/CD
Also experience in scripting automated tests


## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
After all that theory I really wanted some practical experience in what testing is like and this exercise worked wonders. Getting some good expamples of test cases and suites really cleared what the terms ment for me.
